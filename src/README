Hello! If you're here, you're interested in understanding how ddhx works
internally.

This document explains:
- How the codebase is organized
- The program's execution flow
- How the Piece Table + Red-Black tree backend works
- The command-based undo/redo system

For user-facing documentation, see the main README in the project root.

********************************************************************************
* SOURCE STRUCTURE
********************************************************************************

The folder structure is pretty straight-forward:
- backend/
  Contains multiple backends that provides an implementation of a document
  editor.
- document/
  Source documents. Often representing a specific media, such as a file, a disk
  a process, and other physical representation of a source document.
  Currently, only saving to files are supported, it is planned that each
  document will have different strategies to save content.
- os/
  Operation system interfaces.

Files:
- configuration.d
  Contains runtime configuration with functions to change, load and (soon) save
  configurations.
- ddhx.d
  Main application, defines behaviour on what to do, like application commands.
- doceditor.d
  Legacy baggage. Has some enumeration definitions and formatting utilities.
  This is where the document editor used to reside in versions prior to 0.5.
- logger.d
  Stupidly simple logging interface.
- main.d
  Application entry-point. Command-line, configuration, and editor
  initialization.
- pattern.d
  Module for creating patterns.
- platform.d
  Platform definitions.
- ranges.d
  Module for selection ranges.
- transcoder.d
  Character translation module.
- utils.d
  Miscellaneous utilities. Like argument splitting, binary and integer number
  parsing, bufferedwriter, etc.

********************************************************************************
* DOCUMENT EDITOR
********************************************************************************

To keep things simple, only the latest backend (backend/piecev2.d), will be
explained here.

All document editor backends interface IDocumentEditor (backend/base.d), and
are in charge of implementing editor features. Editors allow the editing of
IDocument (document/base.d) instances using the 'IDocumentEditor.open(IDocument)'
function.

The piecev2 backend implements a Piece Table data structure using a Red-black
self-balancing tree. For undo operations, a command-based approach is used.

A piece, simply put, contains the source material (document, buffer, etc.),
the position from the source material, its size (in Bytes), and resources
to the source material (document:file, buffer:memory data, etc.).

(See "Piece types" in the VIEWING section for details on each type)

The red-black tree helps index pieces with their cumulative size. When
searching pieces, because are already sorted by position and size, operations
are relatively fast, comparing to sorting every piece at every operation.

Example of indexed pieces:
+---------------+-------+---------------------+
| Piece         | Piece | Piece               |
+---------------+-------+---------------------+
                ^       ^                     ^
100 ------------+       |                     |
120 --------------------+                     |
220 ------------------------------------------+

When a new instance of this backend is created, a single tree instance is
created with no pieces and an empty command list.

*
* DESIGN RATIONALE
*

Why a Piece Table?
- Memory efficient: Original file data is never duplicated.
- Fast insertions: No need to shift large amounts of data.
- Natural undo/redo: Changes are discrete pieces.

Why a Red-Black Tree?
- Self-balancing ensures consistent O(log n) performance.
- Better than arrays for large documents with many edits.
- Efficient cumulative size indexing for address lookups.

*
* OPENING
*

When opening a document, a single document piece is inserted in the tree.

Visually, a single document piece is inserted:
+--------------------------------------+
| Document                             |
+--------------------------------------+

The piece structure instance inserted in the tree will contain (for example):
  { source=Document, position=0, size=[size of file], doc=[handle to file] }

The command history is cleared and a command entry is not created, unless we
consider opening a file as a form of edition, which is rather rare when it
comes to text editors.

*
* MODIFYING
*

When inserting or replacing data, a new piece is created and inserted into the
tree.

For each operation, some pieces will be truncated (removed and reinserted).

Example of an initial document:
+--------------------------------------+
| Document                             |
+--------------------------------------+

Example of a replace operation with a New piece:
+---------------+-----+----------------+
| Document      | New | Document       |
+---------------+-----+----------------+

Example of an insert operation with a New piece:
+---------------+-----+-----------------------+
| Document      | New | Document              |
+---------------+-----+-----------------------+

When deleting data, existing pieces will be cut and reinserted:
1. +-------------------------------+ Tree contains one piece.
   | Document                      |
   +-------------------------------+
2. +---------------+-----+---------+ Visualization of the piece to cut.
   | Document      | CUT |         |
   +---------------+-----+---------+
3. +---------------+--------+        Sliced piece, because a "gap" is created
   | Document      | Doc    |        with a new position (cut offset) and
   +---------------+--------+        new size.

In debug builds, a consistency check is performed. This check ensures pieces
have proper a size and cumulative size following each other sequentially.

When finished, a new command entry is added to the list of commands.

*
* COMMANDS
*

User actions are recorded as commands in the history stack.

When an operation (insert, replace, delete) is performed, a new command is
created, executed, and added to the list of commands (history).

No snapshot of the tree is taken due to memory concerns, as the piece (v1)
backend demonstrated. Only added pieces and removed indexed pieces are saved.

The Command structure contains the minimum information to perform operations
again. For undo operations, the last operation is reversed.

Applying an operation:
1. Remove indexed pieces mentioned by the command, from the operation.
2. Adjust cumulatives by delta of all pieces after the new cumulative.
3. Add new pieces created by the opreation, with their cumulative adjusted.
4. Update the logical document size by adding delta.

Undoing an operation:
1. Remove pieces that were previously added.
2. Adjust cumulatives by -delta of pieces starting from new cumulative.
3. Add removed pieces.
4. Update logical document size by subtracting delta.

*
* VIEWING
*

When viewing the current document, the tree is traversed until the first
piece within the view range (base position and the size of the view buffer)
is located.

For each piece that needs to be read, their source material is read using the
'IDocument.readAt(long, ubyte[])' function with the base position of the piece
and the slice of the view buffer. This process is repeated until the view
buffer requested is filled, or end of the edited document is reached.

Piece types:
- source:   The original, unmodified document (typically a file on disk).
            This is the "main" source that other pieces reference.
- document: A file IDocument instance. Used when inserting content from
            another file into the current document.
- buffer:   In-memory data created during edits (inserts, replaces).
            Contains the entire data to be applied in the view buffer.
- pattern:  Special pieces for repeated data (e.g., filling with zeros).
            Pattern data is repeated as needed when filling the buffer.
