ddhx is a quick and dirty TUI hexadecimal viewer meant to replace my
[0xdd](https://github.com/dd86k/0xdd) utility, written in a proper system
language, mostly for myself to use.

It also supports dumping.

A lot of the code is pretty crappy, but this was mostly written on in a whim,
so I don't entirely care.
