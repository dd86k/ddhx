This software is provided with NO WARANTY as it is marked as EXPERIMENTAL.

ALWAYS make backups of your files before editing them.

This is a Work In Progress (WIP). Everything was rewritten from scratch
in attempts in version 0.5 to have editing features.

It also outputs UTF-8. You might want to stick to the ASCII charset
setting if your terminal or console lacks UTF-8 capabilities.

//
// Roadmap
//

This list may change at any given time without notice.

0.5:
- [x] Support overwrites
- [x] Support appends
- [x] Save new buffer to file
- [x] Save existing file
- [x] History undo/redo
- [x] Command prompt
- [x] Standard input (stdin) support as new buffer
- [x] Skip to different element (or byte) (Ctrl+Left/Right)

0.6:
- [ ] Support insertions
- [ ] Support deletions
- [ ] Config file support
- [x] "bind" command: map command to shortcut

Future:
- [ ] Support searching
- [ ] Support for other single-byte data types in view (d8, o8)
- [ ] Support for multi-byte data types in view (d16, f32, etc.)
- [ ] Insert characters
- [ ] Insert patterns (e.g., zeros, etc.)
- [ ] Insert file
- [ ] Select multiple elements, copy, and paste

//
// Usage
//

ddhx aims to be a small and easy-to-use visual hexadecimal editor. For that
purpose, there are multiple ways of using the editor.

Sypnopsis:
  ddhx [OPTIONS] [FILE|-]
  ddhx {-h|--help|--version|--ver}

Create a new document:
  $ ddhx
Open an existing or create a new file at this location:
  $ ddhx FILENAME
Create a new document from stream data:
  $ echo test | ddhx -

Minimum recommended terminal size is 80x24 characters.

Navigation can be done using keybinds or commands. Editing is done directly
using the A to F and 0 to 9 keys. And saving is default mapped to Ctrl+S.

Currently, only overwrite and append operations are supported.

The command-line interface matches POSIX guidelines.

To view available start options, execute `ddhx --help`.

//
// Commands
//

Commands can be executed using the command prompt within the editor.

By pressing Return, you can type a command, and then confirm it by pressing the
Return key again.

Some commands have arguments. When these arguments are omitted, the associated
command will prompt for these arguments.

For example, moving the cursor forward of 32 bytes:
  >goto +0x20

Typing "goto" alone will make the program ask for an offset. This command also
has the shortcut of Ctrl+G. In the case of "goto", it accepts decimal, octal,
and hexadecimal values.

Examples of using "goto":
"goto 0x10"
    Go to position 16 bytes (using hexadecimal) within document.
"goto +020"
    Go forward 16 bytes (using octal) from current position.
"goto -5"
    Go backward 5 bytes (using decimal) from current position.
"goto %45"
    Go to position 45% within document (45% of total size).

To view available commands, execute `ddhx --help-commands`.

//
// Keybinds
//

New keybinds can be set at runtime using the "bind" command.

For example "bind right-arrow goto +32" will bind the right arrow key to
"goto +32", which will make it jump 32 bytes ahead. To unbind it, use
"unbind right-arrow" or "reset-keys" to reset all keybindings.

To view default keybinds, execute `ddhx --help-keys`.

//
// Configuration
//

The editor can be configured at runtime using the "set" command.

For example, changing the character set:
  "set charset mac"

Many of these configuration parameters can be set using the Command-Line
Interface. For example, "columns" is mapped to "-c" and "--columns="

To view available configuration options, execute `ddhx --help-configs`.

//
// Compiling & Debugging
//

To compile this project, you'll need a D compiler and DUB.

All major compilers are supported (DMD, GDC, and LDC). LDC, GDC, and DUB are
typically available in package repositories as gdc/gdc-*/gcc-gdc, ldc2, and
dub.

Compile a debug build:
  $ dub build
Compile a release build using a specified compiler:
  $ dub build -b release --compiler=ldc2

Run unit tests with log traces:
  $ dub test --d-version=Trace

ddhx comes with a few debugging options:
  --log=FILENAME to store debugging logs. Useful for reporting bugs.
  --chunksize=N to specify a different size/alignment of edit chunks.
